Nomad:
Scan your neighbors and place all of the dead normal ones in an array.
	Pick one of these at random to become you and replace yourself with a copy of that cell.
If you can’t move, become a normal living cell.

Zombie:
You are always dead.
Scan your neighbors for living cells.
	If it’s a priest, return yourself as a living normal cell.
        If it’s a normal cell, you either kill it or convert it into another zombie.

Priest:
You constantly proselytize to those around you.
While alive, you have a chance to convert others to your faith.
	While dead, you have a drastically lower chance.
Any living priest around your dead body will attempt to lay your soul to rest and turn you back into a normal cell.
If you find a cancer cell in your surroundings, immediately replace it with yourself
 and turn where you were into a living normal cell.

Cancer:
You have a slightly more resilient to death.
In addition, you have a chance with every living tick to convert every one of your dead neighbors
 into a living cancer cell.

Normal:
You now have a small chance to become a nomad if you’re alive.
You have an even smaller chance of becoming a zombie if you're dead.
